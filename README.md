# What is Deflix?

Deflix offers a simple yet efficient strategy for any investor to take part in DeFi with the lowest fee possible on Velas, the fastest blockchain available.

The project is supported by The Llama Team, we have been building DeFi products for months on BSC and are willing to expand to other blockchains. It has always been our priority to provide a more secure and simple space for users to interact with and to be as transparent as possible. All our contracts are open source for everyone to verify.

Our long term goal for Deflix is to help grow the ecosystem on Velas and other EVM-compatible blockchains by providing a safe space both for users and third party projects who wish to become part of our ecosystem.

#### Why is The Llama Team anonymous?

Our projects are open source for everyone to see, the code can be reviewed by anyone who wishes to make certain of how we operate and what we build. We believe decentralization also stands for anonymity, nevertheless it does not mean we are not present and users are welcome to interact with us on the different social media platforms we use. Our global community managers and team members can be contacted anytime through our official telegram. Remember that no one representing Deflix will ever contact you first or ask you to provide wallet keys or recovery codes.
