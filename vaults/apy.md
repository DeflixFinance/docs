# APY

When browsing the vaults on the platform, you will see the annual percentage yield (APY), which takes the frequent compounding into consideration compared to annual percentage rate (APR) which does not.

All farms are auto-compounded at least 3 times a day.

#### **How comes the APY shown when deposited is not the same now?**

APY is the “Annual percentage yield” and is your daily yield compounded. The daily yield in turn is based on factors such as the yield rate and the total amount deposited that share this yield. When more people and in turn tokens enter the pool, the fixed yield is shared by more people (tokens) hence the daily yield will become lower and in turn, lower the APY. In the same way, if people (tokens) exit the vault, there are fewer people (tokens) sharing the fixed reward and the daily yield will increase and in turn, APY will increase.
