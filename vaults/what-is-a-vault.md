# What is a Vault?

Vaults are investment instruments that employ a specific set of strategies for yield farming. They make use of smart contracts to continually invest and reinvest deposited funds, which helps to achieve high levels of compounded interest. By using a Deflix vault to compound your gains, you save time and gas costs. Instead of manually harvesting and selling rewards, buying more tokens, and reinvesting that continuously, a vault does all that automatically at a high frequency.
