# Security & risks

Assets deposited into the vault have no risk of decreasing in quantity but can decrease in monetary value.

With any smart contract, the ultimate risk is that an investor's funds can end up stolen or unable to be withdrawn. The team does take steps to quantify the security risks of smart contracts and only will interact with ones that meet a specific set of requirements after excessive testing to make sure the underlying platform does not contain so called 'rug-pull' functions.

The vaults are hardcoded meaning that no one can modify the vaults or strategy and no one has access to users' funds.

To release a new strategy on any asset, a new vault and strategy smart contract must be built.

#### Is Deflix audited?

We are using contracts that are already audited and available on other blockchains.
