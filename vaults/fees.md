# Fees

Vaults have a deposit fee of max 0.1% (to prevent possible exploits from bad-faith actors. Deposit fees stay in the vault and are shared amongst vault users) and 0% for withdrawals; there is an additional performance fee of 3.5% on harvested rewards. These fees are already taken into account in the APY shown in each vault. You do not need to calculate these yourself.
